\mc{Memory-bus} & \mc{This enumerates the memory, as it can't be attached to the cpu directly, it would simply be a too long string.} \\

\hline
\mc{\textbf{Instruction Set}} & \mc{A processor has a certain instruction set, that accesses it's own immediate register as well as request data from cache/memory. This is also the problem with Intel and AMD, they can't opensource their hardware properly as the instruction set is licensed by intel to other vendors. Therefore all hail Risc-V!} \\
\hline
\mc{} & \mc{Instructions are something like copy value of x into y, or write value u into p. But, there is also the instruction to simply do nothing!} \\
\hline
\mc{Sequence} & \mc{Just as the name says, it's a sequence of instructions to do something more specific than writing a value. Programs for example are just sequences of instructions. As we know, this is stored inside memory and is as stated above accessed by memory-bus.} \\

\mc{register} & \mc{Special datastructure inside the cpu that is even faster and smaller than the cache.} \\

\mc{Machine-Code} & \mc{The machine code is simply the encoding which the Sequences have to be in, in order for the CPU to understand the instructions. This is also why ARM programs do not run on an x86 system. The memory instructions would not be readable by the cpu. Rosetta is essentially just decoding and encoding these instructions.} \\
\hline
\mc{System-clock-cycle} & \mc{The entire system runs by the processor clock-cycle, it has 2 states, one constant sate, where values can only be read, and one change-able state, where any other operation can be done.} \\
\hline
\mc{Processor-cycle} & \mc{ 1. Processor orders the instructions from the memory with pointer.\\
  2. Processor decodes the Operation and Operands from the instruction.\\
  3. Processor chooses the corresponding core part (Baustein \#FuckGerman).\\
  4. Active Core might read from register.\\
  5. Active Core (part of it) executes operation.\\
  6. Active Core might write to register.\\
  7. Processor moves pointer according to operation size.\\

A simple length calculation in assembly & \vspace{2mm} \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{2022-09-27-04:27:52.png}\newline 
First we define a label called length, but we can't calculate this yet as my\_text and after\_my\_text aren't defined yet.\newline
So we continue to the next line, here we write BSys 1?! and set the value of my\_text to 08 00 00 00 00 00 00.\newline
Then we define after\_my\_text with the value of the offset at this point, which is 0F 00 00 00 00 00 00 00.\newline
At last the length will have the value of 08 00 00 00 00 00 00 00, which is the length of BSys 1?!.\\

write 2 bytes aka a word to file. offset is now at 16, or 10 in hex.\newline

\subsection{Objects in C}
\begin{tabular}{|m{0.977\linewidth}|}
\hline
\textcolor{orange}{\textbf{C is not object oriented, objects are not the same as in C++}\newline
When we talk about objects in C, then we talk about any variable instance, for example an integer is an object.}\newline
\textcolor{teal}{Each object has some sort of value, for integer this is a number.}\newline
\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{In the end, an object is just an allocation of memory!}}\newline
The reason for this is that we once thought we might have a different way of storing things at some point\newline
Turns out this was wrong and we still use memory for storing everything.\\

\begin{tabular}{|m{0.2\linewidth}|m{0.755\linewidth}|}
\hline
Operations in C & 
\textcolor{orange}{C will enforce operand type equality, this means that it will try to cast to get this,\newline
or it will simply not work.}\\
\hline
Existence of types & 
Just like c++, after you compile C, it will no longer have types, just like assembly.\newline
Types only exist to make it easier to program.\\
\hline
\textbf{sizeof(T)}&
\textcolor{orange}{Each type has a size that you can check, however, this is compiler, OS and even architecture dependent!\newline This can therefore not be taken for granted.}\newline
\textcolor{red}{However, this is one of the reasons that C and C++ is so fast!}\\
\hline
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{minimum} size of variables}&
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{signed char} \(\geq\) 8 Bit
  \item \textcolor{teal}{short int} \(\geq\) 16 Bit
  \item \textcolor{teal}{int} \(\geq\) 16 Bit \(\geq\) short
  \item \textcolor{teal}{long int} \(\geq\) 32 Bit
  \item \textcolor{teal}{long long int} \(\geq\) 64 Bit
  \item \textcolor{teal}{void} no real value!

\begin{table}[ht!]
\begin{tabular}{|m{0.2\linewidth}|m{0.755\linewidth}|}

signed or unsigned & 
\textcolor{orange}{Just like in c++ you can write unsigned to get the max possible positive number.\newline
the default is signed, which has both negative and positive values!}\\
\hline
Other Types in C & 
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{Array-Types}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{Struct-Types}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{Union-Types}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{Pointer-Types}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{Function-Types}

\hline
Pointer types& 
\textcolor{orange}{\textbf{A pointer is just a number, it is an integer}}\newline
\textcolor{teal}{They simply \emph{point} to an address, this an be any address even another pointer address!}
\begin{lstlisting}
int num = 5;
int* nump; // pointer to int
int num2 = *nump; 
// dereference the pointer and assign the value of it to num2
int** numpp = &nump;
// create a pointer to a pointer with the address of nump
\end{lstlisting}
\\
\hline
Decimal,Octal and Hex & 
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{Decimal: 0..9 with \textbf{NO 0 at the start}} 
  \item \textcolor{teal}{Octal: 0..7 with a \textbf{leading 0}} 
  \item \textcolor{teal}{Hex: 0..F with \textbf{0x at the start}} 
  \item \textcolor{teal}{Suffix: the suffix specifies the type:}\newline
    l long,ll long long ,u unsigned,ul .. ,ull ..
  \vspace{-3mm}
\end{itemize}\\
\hline
Casts & 
\textcolor{orange}{Casts are just like in c++}\newline
\begin{lstlisting}
double ping = 5.5;
int pang = (int)ping;
\end{lstlisting}\\
\hline
Bitwise Operators & 
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{not: \ascitilde q}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{and: q \& p }
  \item \textcolor{teal}{or: q | p}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{or: q ^ p}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{or: q << p} left shift
  \item \textcolor{teal}{or: q >> p} right shift
\end{itemize}
\, \newline
\textcolor{teal}{Bitwise operators always return the same type we entered!}\newline 
\textcolor{orange}{Unlike assembly, you can't use rotate directly!} \\
\hline
Arithmic Operators& 
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{not: !q}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{and: q \&\& p}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{or: q || p}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{greater than: >}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{smaller than: <}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{greater than or equal: >=}
  \item \textcolor{teal}{smaller than or equal: <=}
\end{itemize}
\, \newline
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{The return type of these is int NOT bool!}}\newline
The reason for this is that C is a very old language and bool didn't exist when it was created.\\
